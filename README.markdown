Irssi URL Shortener
===================

Once upon a time a man was just SICK and TIRED of irssi and it's url breaking line wrapping. This man was also using a very wobbly debian install on a memory starved vps. This meant that CPAN would run out of memory no matter what he tried to do.

Instead of fixing these problems this man decided to write a URL shortener that doesn't require any external modules.

Hi.
